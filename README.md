# Work/Project Examples
**1.SAIT Wayfinder**

This is a web application that I developed for my SAIT capstone project. The challenge was to incorporate Bluetooth beacon technology into the application. My solution was to plot the beacons location at the destinations our users will navigate to. The user will enter their starting and ending location which will initialize the navigation in google maps.

Roles:
- Design and develop the architecture and core application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Maps API
- Ensure application is responsive throughout multiple screen resolutions
- Research Bluetooth beacon technology and Google Maps API
- Setup and configure Blutooth beacons
- Field work: mapping out flightpaths and installing beacons to various locations
- Testing and debugging
- Manage team and ensure assets and deliverables are on schedule
