# Work/Project Examples
**1.SAIT Wayfinder Application**

This is a web application that I developed for my SAIT capstone project. The challenge was to incorporate Bluetooth beacon technology into the application. My solution was to plot the beacons location at the destinations our users will navigate to. The user will enter their starting and ending location which will initialize the navigation in google maps.

Roles:
- Design and develop the architecture and core application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Maps API
- Ensure application is responsive throughout multiple screen resolutions
- Research Bluetooth beacon technology and Google Maps API
- Setup and configure Blutooth beacons
- Field work: mapping out flightpaths and installing beacons to various locations
- Testing and debugging
- Manage team and ensure assets and deliverables are on schedule

**2.RawAF eCommerce Website**

This is a website I developed for a school assignment. The task was to create our own fictional brand and products to be sold through our fictional eCommerce website where users are able to browse products by category as well as add and checkout items in their cart.

Roles:
- Design and development of the website using HTML, CSS, and PHP
- Create database for my products using MySQL
- Ensure website is responsive accross multiple screen resolutions using CSS @media queries
- Graphic design: asset creation using Photoshop
- Design and develop the cart system

**3.Weather Application**

This is a simple weather application that asks for the users geolocation in order to display their current city, weather in °C or °F(depending if their country uses the Imperial system), wind speed, and wind direction in MPH or KMPH(also depending if their country uses the Imperial system).

Roles:
- Develop the core application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and OpenWeatherMap API
- Research countries that use the Imperial system for unit measurement

# Inspiration
**Only CSS: 3D Scan**

This project inspired me because I think it's amazing what you can do using only CSS. I only know basic CSS and Bootstrap, but I know that there are CSS preprocessors like Sass and LESS. What intrigued me by this project is that I noticed there are jQuery-like selectors holding variables and properties using the $ sign. There is also the use of the @for loop that are looping through the $ sign variables that I found interesting because I did not you can do programming in CSS! I have only used CSS for styling my websites and applications, but eventualy I want to become a CSS wizard and learn how to make really cool graphic animations like this 3D Scan that I can utilize in my future portfolio and projects.

**Scroll To Top Then Fixed Navigation Effect With jQuery and CSS**

This is a simple codepen application, if the window is greater than the navigation height it adds a fixed class, or else it will remove the fixed class. This is great when we want to feature a landing page with the navigation at the bottom of the screen, and as we scroll down page the navigation will scroll as well, but it will stop at the top of the page so we can still reference it. However, what I find interesting about this application is how short the JavaScript code is. I am currently learning jQuery and I am already seeing how much faster we can select HTML and CSS elements as well as shortening JavaScript code. Without the help of jQuery, this application would have to declare alot more variables and therefore would have more lines of code. As I continue learning higher levels of coding compared to lower levels, I am continuously seeing how easier, shorter, and cleaner we can write code. Coming from learning vanilla JavaScript, it is extremely motivating when I am able to write code with less logic because I am able to create faster. However, I do not underestimate being able to code at low levels because it is just as important when creating customized components.

**React Reduction Demo with Bootstrap**

Since I am currently learning basic web development I have not been able to delve into the world of modern React and Redux. This demo inspires me because I see the possibilities of React and Bootstrap and the ability to quickly create beautiful web applications like this demo. Browsing through this website and seeing the animations and professional quality on the graphs/charts as I hover my mouse over them is a very motivating factor and reminds me why I want to learn React and Redux.

# Focus

If I were given the opportunity during my internship to learn/build anything I wanted it would be to focus on JavaScript development and learn Node.js and React and possibly build a website or application using these technologies. I have purchased an online Modern React with Redux course that I have not started and a Web Development Bootcamp course that I have been working through since the end of my school semester that is now 50% complete. I think these are powerful learning tools and I would like to leverage these resources for my continued education in web development. I would also greatly benefit from a mentor who is able to guide me in the right direction towards my career goals.
